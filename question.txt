Is Palindrome
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

Output: true
Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: s = "tab a cat"

Output: false
Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s is made up of only printable ASCII characters.
